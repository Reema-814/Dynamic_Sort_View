Dynamic Sort View

Overview:
Goal: To visualize the working of different sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe the comparisons, 
swaps, and final sorted outcome with real-time updates. Highlight the sorted array in green at the end.

Key Features:

User Interaction:
Users can select the sorting algorithm they want to see.
Provide options to adjust the speed of visualization (slow, medium, fast).
Allow users to input their own arrays or randomly generate arrays to be sorted.

Visual Feedback:
Highlight the current elements being compared in a different color (e.g., yellow or red).
Show the swapping process with a visual transition.
Once the sorting is complete, highlight the sorted array in green.

Frontend:
HTML/CSS for the basic layout and design.
JavaScript (or a framework like React) for the dynamic visualization.
Use CSS stylings and animations for rendering the sorting visualizations.
